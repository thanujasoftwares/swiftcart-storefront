# you want this VirtualHost record to handle.

ServerName hsshoppie.com

# Optional. You can specify additional host names that
# serve up the same site. This can be top-level, domains,
# sub-domains, and can even use wildcard subdomains such
# as *.yourdomain.com - just separate each host name
# with a single space.

#ServerAlias www.yourdomain.com yourdomain.net

# this vhost site's files.

DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/hsshoppie.com

# address, if you have one. If there is a server error,
# this is the address that Apache will show to users.

#ServerAdmin you@example.com

# a different error log file than the default. You will
# need to create the error file first.

# this site. Don't forget to change the file path to
# match your DocumentRoot setting above.
